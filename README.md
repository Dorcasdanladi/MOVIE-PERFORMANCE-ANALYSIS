### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze movie-related data to uncover trends, insights, and patterns related to the performance, reception, and characteristics of movies over time

### Data source

The primary dataset utilized for this analysis is sourced from the "IMDB" file, comprising comprehensive movies data essential for the movie analytics project

### Tools used

-	SQL for querying, filtering, and organizing the data.
-	Power BI for visualizing insights and creating interactive dashboards

## Data Preparation and Data Cleaning Process in MySQL Workbench

1.	Database Creation: Establish a database named "NETFLIX MOVIES."
2.	Import Data: Import the MOVIES dataset as csv file into the database.
3.	Check Data Types: Review data types of all columns using the "CHARINDEX" command.
4. Standardize Date Formats: Use SQL functions to standardize date formats and convert text to date data types
5. Address Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values.
6.	Update Data Types: Review and modify data types as needed, such as changing text to date or integer using UPDATE and CHARINDEX command
7.	Ensure Data Integrity: Validate data integrity and consistency throughout the process.

#### Note: Data cleaning and data analysis SQL files are attached for reference

## Visualization in Power BI

-	After completing data cleaning and analysis in MySQL, the results were exported to CSV files.
-	These CSV files served as the basis for creating a visually appealing dashboard in Power BI.
-	The purpose of this Power BI dashboard was to provide a better understanding of the outcomes derived from the SQL data analysis.
-	It's important to note that the Power BI dashboard created is non-interactive; it was designed solely for visually representing the insights obtained through SQL data analysis

## Findings from the Analysis

- The gross amount of $587 billion emphasizes that this collection of movies has generated substantial worldwide earnings, likely indicating that many of the films in the dataset were blockbusters or highly popular
- With 675 million total votes, it indicates that the movies in the dataset attracted significant audience engagement, reflecting a wide viewership
- Given the combination of high total gross, votes, and substantial revenue, it can be inferred that this dataset contains a significant number of successful, possibly blockbuster movies, this dataset represents a very commercially successful group of films, with a large audience and strong financial performance

## Limitations

- Exclusion of Blank Records: During the data analysis process, a total of 2473 of blanks were recorded in some columns; Budget (2173), Gross (189), Company (17), Runtime (4), Witter (3), Star (1), Votes (3), Released (2), and Rating (77) column. These records were excluded from the analysis

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that movie success is driven by multiple factors, including budget, genre, key contributors (directors, writers, and stars), and market trends. The following conclusions can be drawn:
- Big budgets often lead to higher gross revenues, particularly in genres like Action and Drama
- The influence of directors and stars is significant in determining a movieâ€™s box office performance and critical reception.
